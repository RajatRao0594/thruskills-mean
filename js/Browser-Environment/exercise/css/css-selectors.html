    <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
    <p>CSS is composed of style rules that the browser interprets and then applies to the corresponding elements in your document</p>
    <p id="firstPara">A style rule has 3 parts: <strong>selector</strong>, <strong>property</strong>, <strong>value</strong></p>
    <code>
        h1 {color :orange;}
    </code>

    <h2 class="head2 fw">Type Selectors</h2>

    <h2 class="head2"> Second Heading</h2>


    <p class="head2">The most common and easy to understand selectors are type selectors. This selector targets element types on the page.</p>

    <h2>id and class</h2>
    <p>id selectors allow you to style an HTML element that has an id attribute, regardless of their position in the document tree.</p>
    <p>Class selectors work in a similar way. The major difference is that id's can be applied once per page</p>


    <h2>Descendant Selectors</h2>
    <p>These selectors are used to select elements that are descendants of another element. When selecting levels, you can select as many deep levels deep as you want to</p>
